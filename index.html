Polymyositis (PM)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Polymyositis (PM)</h1>
<h3><marquee>A group of muscle diseases that cause inflammation of muscle and their associated tissues, including blood vessels. </marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">
<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Muscle weakness: This is the most common symptom. The muscles involved usually are those closest to the trunk of the body, and the onset of weakness is usually gradual, occurring over 3 to 6 months or rarely the symptoms come on rapidly.</li><li>
Difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, or lifting objects: Some people also have trouble with getting up after lying down.
Difficulty swallowing.</li><li>
Muscle ache: In some cases, muscles ache and are tender to the touch.</li><li>
Fatigue.</li><li>
Shortness of breath due to heart and lung involvement.</li><li>
Patchy red or violet rash around the eyes: Some people also get patchy, red skin over the knuckles, elbows and knees or a red rash on the neck and upper chest.</li><li>
Fever.</li><li>
Weight loss.</li></ul>


<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>The cause of polymyositis is not known, but there are indications that heredity plays a role in the disease.</p><p>

Current research suggests that the condition may occur when immune system cells infiltrate and attack muscle tissue (an autoimmune process).
</p><p>
Research into the workings of the immune system and what causes it to malfunction may result in more knowledge about the causes of polymyositis.</p>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>The diagnosis of the disease usually begins with a physicianâ€™s exam and blood testing. People who have polymyositis often have unusually high levels of muscle enzymes. The enzymes are released into the blood by muscle that is being damaged by inflammation. Routine blood and urine tests can check for internal organ abnormalities. Chest X-rays, mammograms, PAP smears, and other screening tests might be considered to look for signs of cancers that may arise with polymyositis. Additional testing can rule out other conditions resembling polymyositis.</p><p>

Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity studies are electrical tests of muscle and nerves that can show abnormal findings typical of polymyositis. These tests also can rule out other nerve-muscle diseases. Imaging of the muscles can show areas of muscle inflammation and can be used to find muscle biopsy sites.
</p><p>

Muscle biopsy is a surgical procedure in which muscle tissue is removed and examined. A muscle biopsy is used to confirm the presence of muscle inflammation typical only of polymyositis.</p>

<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>
<p>Polymyositis is treated with high doses of corticosteroids as a first course of treatment. Corticosteroids are given because they can effectively decrease the inflammation in the muscles. Corticosteroids do not always adequately improve polymyositis. In these patients immunosuppressive medications are considered</p>
